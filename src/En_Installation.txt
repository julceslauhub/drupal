------ Installing MRSync for Drupal -------
-------------------------------------------

The installation of the MRSync product for Drupal is very simple. It only takes a few steps to do it. This includes uploading some files by FTP, and doing some configuration in the admin panel.

After installing the extension a new menu will appear on the left panel, this menu will let you sync all your Drupal users with your Mailrelay account. This will save you time when syncing and organizing your users in groups.

Let's start with the installation process:

-------------------
First required step
-------------------

The first step, in order for us to be able to use the extension, is to enable the API key of our Mailrelay account. For that we need to log in our Mailrelay account admin panel. Once we are there we will go to the "Settings" menu, then "API access". On that screen click on the "Generate new API key" button. It's not necessary for us to write down this key, once it's generated, the extension will be able to get it using your user and password data.

----------------------------------------
Upload the necessary files to the server
----------------------------------------

For uploading these files we can use an FTP software, like the free Filezilla ( http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client ). We will also require the access data to our FTP account, usually your hosting provider, where you have installed your Drupal software, will be able to provide you with this data.

The files we need to upload are the following ( to the left you can see the source file, and to the right the destination file ):

- mailrelay/mailrelay.admin.inc       ==> sites/all/modules/mailrelay/mailrelay.admin.inc
- mailrelay/mailrelay.info            ==> sites/all/modules/mailrelay/mailrelay.info
- mailrelay/mailrelay.module          ==> sites/all/modules/mailrelay/mailrelay.module

------------------------------------
Installation from Drupal admin panel
------------------------------------

Once we have uploaded all the required files, we need to do some configs from the admin panel:

- We will go to the "Administer" option
- Sub-menu Site building > Modules
- We will search the "Mailrelay Sync" module that is under the "Others" group
- If the checkbox is not selected, we will check it
- Next we will click on "Save settings".

This finishes the installation process.

-------------------------
Configuring the extension
-------------------------

Once the extension is installed we will have a new settings option. We will go to the upper Configuration option.
In this menu there is the option "Mailrelay Sync settings". Clicking on this option will take us to a form where we need to fill the following data:

- Hostname for Mailrelay (this can be found in your Mailrelay welcome email)
- API key (the API key generated for our Mailrelay account)

Once this data is successfully saved we can start the user sync.

----------
Sync users
----------

In the top menu bar, we will see a new option called "Mailrelay Sync process". We can use this option to sync the users of our system, with our Mailrelay account.
This will take us to a screen where we can select the groups of our Mailrelay account that must be sync with the Drupal users.
We will click them and will press the button "Start sync process".

We will see the following screen, that simply shows us the sync process. It shows the total users synced.

[ NOTE: Depending on the number of users to sync, the process can take from some seconds to several minutes. ]

---------
Uninstall
---------

Uninstalling the extension is as easy as installing it. You only have to go to the option Modules in the upper menu.
You must search for the Mailrelay Sync module and disable it. Selecting this option, the extension will be disabled.
The files won't be removed from ftp, to do that you must remove the right folder under sites/all/modules.
